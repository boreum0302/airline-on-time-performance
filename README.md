[2009 Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/)

> The aim of the data expo is to provide a graphical summary of important features of the data set. This is intentionally vague in order to allow different entries to focus on different aspects of the data, but here are a few ideas to get you started:

> When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
> - Do older planes suffer more delays?
> - How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
> - How well does weather predict plane delays?
> - Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?

> You are also welcome to work with interesting subsets: you might want to compare flight patterns before and after 9/11, or between the pair of cities that you fly between most often, or all flights to and from a major airport like Chicago (ORD). Smaller subsets may also help you to match up the data to other interesting datasets.
